            <h3>GalaxyJS is library to help you to implement your web application into isolated modules</h3>
            <p>
                It's build on the premise that it's not a framework but a library.

            <h2>Why GalaxyJS?</h2>

            <h3>Easy to learn... That's it!</h3>

            <p>
                The difference between Vanilla JS and a Javascript framework is like the difference between a galaxy and
                a planet. Planets exist inside the galaxy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each planet has its own atmosphere, its environment, its local rules and its ecosystem <i>(if there is
                life on that planet of course)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                With GalaxyJS you can create your own favorite application ecosystem <i>(framework)</i>, which suits
                your project the best.
