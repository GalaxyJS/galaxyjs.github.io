      <h1 >Welcome to GalaxyJS</h1>
      <h3>GalaxyJS is library to help you to implement your web application into isolated modules</h3>
      <p>
        It's build on the premise that it's not a framework but a library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things you need to know before start using GalaxyJS
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It's depends on Javascript <strong>new Function()</strong> feature
        </li>     
        <li>
          Its structure encourages you to write more DRY code
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why GalaxyJS?</h2>
      
      <h3>Easy to learn... and again, easy to learn</h3>

      <p>
        The difference between Vanilla JS and a Javascript framework is like the difference between a galaxy and a planet. Planets exist inside the galaxy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each planet has its own atmosphere, its environment, its local rules and its ecosystem <i>(if there is life on that planet of course)</i>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't get me wrong, frameworks are great. They offer an structure for the app, patterns to program, generic solutions to problems and etc 
        which are huge deals BUT these don't mean better application.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact that's one of the most important thing that a framework offers. It gives you a frame to work in so you don't need to know or understand everything.
        You only need to know the frame and how to work with it which is way easier than understanding or working with the framework's underlying technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other important thing a framework offers is, consistency in the structure of the app <i>(At least it tries to unless the developer mess up)</i>.
      </p>
