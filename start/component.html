    <h1 >Welcome to GalaxyJS</h1>
    <h3>GalaxyJS is library to help you to implement your web application into isolated components</h3>
    <p>
      It offers a simple structure <strong>'How to write your web app'</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Things you need to know before start using GalaxyJS
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's not a framework
      </li>
      <li>
        GalaxyJS components are not web components, they are parts that make up the application
      </li>
      <li>
        Its structure encourages you to write more DRY code
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why GalaxyJS?</h2>
    
    <p>
      The difference between Vanilla JS and a Javascript framework is like the difference between a planet and a galaxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't get me wrong, frameworks are great. They offer generic solutions, structure for the app, patterns to program and etc 
      which are huge deals BUT these don't mean better application, also using a frameworks doesn't make you a better programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact that's one of the most important thing that a framework offers. It gives you a frame to work so you don't need to know or understand everything.
      You only need to know the frame and how to work with which is way easier than understanding or working with the framework underlying technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other important thing a framework offers is consistency in the structure of the app.
